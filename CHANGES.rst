Changelog
=========

0.11.1 (TBD)
------------

- Added CIDR parsing for RDAP lookups.

0.11.0 (2015-11-02)
-------------------

- Support for REST lookups replaced with RDAP.
- Split code for a more structured system (net, whois, rdap, exceptions).
- Tests match the data new structure.
- Split tests for online and offline testing.
- Performance enhancements for parsing.
- Added an optional bootstrap parameter for RDAP lookups, in order to replace
  ASN lookups or use both. Will default to False. Afrinic is currently not
  supported, so I would not use this for now. ARIN acknowledged my issue
  for this, and will be adding support back in for Afrinic bootstrap.
- Added field_list parameter (inclusion list) for WHOIS lookups.
- Added logging.
- Added examples directory.

0.10.3 (2015-08-14)

  new parsed formatting is complete.
