  IPWhois.lookup_rdap(), and RDAP.lookup(). New exception HTTPRateLimitError.

- Added allow_permutations parameter (bool) to net.Net() and ipwhois.IPWhois()
  to allow alternate ASN lookups if DNS lookups fail. (FirefighterBlu3)

0.11.1 (2015-12-17)

- Re-added CIDR calculation for RDAP lookups.
- Improved tests - core code coverage now 100%. See '# pragma: no cover' for
  exclusions. A few bugs were identified in the process, detailed below.
- Moved IP zero stripping from rdap._RDAPNetwork.parse() to new helper function
  utils.ipv4_lstrip_zeros().
- Moved CIDR calculation from rdap._RDAPNetwork.parse() to new helper function
  utils.calculate_cidr().

  Loopback (conflict with Reserved).
- Added is_offline parameter to whois.Whois.lookup() primarily for testing.
- Fixed bug in whois.Whois._parse_fields() that attempted to parse 'val2' of
  regex, which is no longer used. Also fixed the expected Exception to be
  IndexError.
- Fixed bug in ipwhois.IPWhois.lookup() where the argument order was mixed up,
  causing referral lookups to be skipped when get_referral=True.
- Fixed bug in rdap._RDAPCommon.summarize_notices() output for links.
- Fixed bug in root entity iteration exception handling in rdap.RDAP.lookup().

0.11.0 (2015-11-02)
-------------------

- Support for REST lookups replaced with RDAP.
- Split code for a more structured system (net, whois, rdap, exceptions).
- Tests match the data new structure.
- Split tests for online and offline testing.
- Performance enhancements for parsing.
- Added an optional bootstrap parameter for RDAP lookups, in order to replace
  ASN lookups or use both. Will default to False. Afrinic is currently not
  supported, so I would not use this for now. ARIN acknowledged my issue
  for this, and will be adding support back in for Afrinic bootstrap.
- Added field_list parameter (inclusion list) for WHOIS lookups.
- Added logging.
- Added examples directory.

0.10.3 (2015-08-14)
