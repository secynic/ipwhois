Summary
=======

ipwhois is a Python package focused on retrieving and parsing whois data
for IPv4 and IPv6 addresses.

.. note::

    If you are experiencing latency issues, it is likely related to rate
    limiting. Rate limiting is based on your source IP, which may be a problem
    with multiple users behind the same proxy. Additionally, LACNIC implements
    aggressive rate limiting. Experimental bulk query support is new as of
    v1.0.0.

Features
========

* Parses a majority of whois fields in to a standard dictionary
* IPv4 and IPv6 support
* Supports RDAP queries (recommended method, see:
  https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7483)
* Proxy support for RDAP queries
* Supports legacy whois protocol queries
* Referral whois support for legacy whois protocol
* Recursive network parsing for IPs with parent/children networks listed
* National Internet Registry support for JPNIC and KRNIC
* Supports IP to ASN and ASN origin queries
* Python 2.7 and 3.4+ supported
* Useful set of utilities
* Experimental bulk query support
* BSD license
* Human readable field translations
* Full CLI for IPWhois with optional ANSI colored console output.

API
===

IPWhois (main class)
--------------------

ipwhois.IPWhois is the base class for wrapping RDAP and Legacy Whois lookups.
Instantiate this object, then call one of the lookup functions:

`RDAP (HTTP) - IPWhois.lookup_rdap() <#rdap-http>`_
OR
`Legacy Whois - IPWhois.lookup_whois() <#legacy-whois>`_

Input

| **Key**            |**Type**| **Description**                               |

+--------------------+--------+-----------------------------------------------+

RDAP (HTTP)
-----------

IPWhois.lookup_rdap() is the recommended lookup method. RDAP provides a
far better data structure than legacy whois and REST lookups (previous
implementation). RDAP queries allow for parsing of contact information and
details for users, organizations, and groups. RDAP also provides more detailed
network information.

RDAP documentation:

https://ipwhois.readthedocs.io/en/latest/RDAP.html

Legacy Whois
------------

.. note::

    Legacy Whois output is different from RDAP. See the below JSON outputs for
    a comparison:

    Legacy Whois:
    https://ipwhois.readthedocs.io/en/latest/WHOIS.html#basic-usage

    RDAP:
    https://ipwhois.readthedocs.io/en/latest/RDAP.html#basic-usage

Legacy Whois documentation:

https://ipwhois.readthedocs.io/en/latest/WHOIS.html

National Internet Registries
----------------------------

This library now supports NIR lookups for JPNIC and KRNIC. Previously, Whois
and RDAP data for Japan and South Korea was restricted. NIR lookups scrape
these national registries directly for the data restricted from regional
internet registries. NIR queries are enabled by default via the inc_nir
argument in the IPWhois.lookup_*() functions.

https://ipwhois.readthedocs.io/en/latest/NIR.html

Autonomous System Numbers
-------------------------

This library now supports ASN origin lookups via Whois and HTTP.

IP ASN functionality was moved to its own parser API (IPASN).

There is no CLI for these yet.

Experimental Functions
----------------------

.. caution::

    Functions in experimental.py contain new functionality that has not yet
    been widely tested. Bulk lookup support contained here can result in
    significant system/network resource utilization. Additionally, abuse of
    this functionality may get you banned by the various services queried by
    this library. Use at your own discretion.

IP Reputation Support
=====================

This feature is under consideration. Take a look at TekDefense's Automater:

`TekDefense-Automater <https://github.com/1aN0rmus/TekDefense-Automater>`_

Domain Support
==============

There are no plans for domain whois support in this project.

Look at Sven Slootweg's
`python-whois <https://github.com/joepie91/python-whois>`_ for a library with
domain support.

Special Thanks
==============

Thank you JetBrains for the `PyCharm <https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/>`_
open source support!

Thank you Chris Wells (`@cdubz <https://github.com/cdubz>`_) for your
extensive testing on the experimental functions!

Last but not least, thank you to all the issue submitters and contributors.
