ipwhois
=======

ipwhois is a Python package focused on retrieving and parsing whois data
for IPv4 and IPv6 addresses.

RDAP is the recommended query method as of v0.11.0. Please see the
`upgrade info <https://github.com/secynic/ipwhois/blob/master/RDAP.rst
#upgrading-from-0-10-to-0-11>`_.

IPWhois.lookup() is deprecated as of v0.12.0 and will be removed. Legacy whois
lookups were moved to IPWhois.lookup_whois().

Features
========

* Parses a majority of whois fields in to a standard dictionary
* IPv4 and IPv6 support
* Referral whois support
* Supports RDAP queries (recommended method, more detailed information)
* Proxy support for RDAP queries
* Recursive network parsing for IPs with parent/children networks listed
* Python 2.6+ and 3.3+ supported
* Useful set of utilities
* BSD license
* 100% core code coverage (See '# pragma: no cover' for exclusions)
* Human readable field translations
* Full CLI for IPWhois with optional ANSI colored console output.

API
===

RDAP (HTTP)
-----------

IPWhois.lookup_rdap() is the recommended lookup method. RDAP provides a
far better data structure than legacy whois and REST lookups (previous
implementation). RDAP queries allow for parsing of contact information and
details for users, organizations, and groups. RDAP also provides more detailed
network information.

Legacy Whois
------------

IPWhois.lookup() is deprecated as of v0.12.0 and will be removed. Legacy whois
lookups were moved to IPWhois.lookup_whois().

IP Reputation Support
=====================

This feature is under consideration. Take a look at TekDefense's Automater:

`TekDefense-Automater <https://github.com/1aN0rmus/TekDefense-Automater>`_

Domain Support
==============

There are no plans for domain whois support in this project.

Look at Sven Slootweg's
`python-whois <https://github.com/joepie91/python-whois>`_ for a library with
domain support.

Special Thanks
==============

Thank you JetBrains for the PyCharm open source support!
